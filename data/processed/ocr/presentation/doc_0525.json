At present\ntime, this legislation pertains to food ingredients and not to foad additives, flavorings or colors.\nThe Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) has alsa enacted regutations concerning\nfoods produced using genetically modified material. The regulations make it illegal to sell\nfoods which are derived fram GM material that has not been approved by ANZFA. With\nrespect to GM material that has been approved, regulations require labeling of foods which are\nnot substantially equivalent to conventional foods. Currently, the regulations do not cover\nfood additives, including vitamins and minerals, and processing aids.\nSweeteners made from corn, including high fructase corn syrups, carn syrups, dextrose,\nmaltodextrins and crystailine fructose are made by hydralysis of the starch fraction of the\ncorn. Archer Daniels Midland Campany's (ADM) pollcy is to procure its raw material corn from\ninternationally approved crop sources. Last year's U.S. growing season saw a minority portion\nof the corn crop consisting of GM varieties. Because of our large scale, these sources could\nnot be segregated from one another. Consequently, aur products derived fram carn may or\nmay not arise from GM derived raw materiais. However, starch hydrolysates have been tested\nand it has been commonly accepted that GM DNA is nat present in this product stream from\ncorn.\nThe European Commission has been directed to generate a \"negative list\" of foods that are\nhighly processed and will not require labeling, however, these details have not yet been\nsuppliad. In the absence of.these details, the major European trade association, Confederation\ndes Industries Agro-Alimentaires de I'UE (CtAA) recommends that starch hydrolysates (e.g.\nmaltodextrin, corn syrup, dextrose, high fructose corn syrup. ete.} fram transgenic corn need\nnot be labeled.\nADM recagnizes the importance of this issue to your business. We want to assure you that\nwe will continue to provide assistance to help identity the carrect tabefing of ADM products,\nwhere passible.\n2079062857\nMC-600_990519\nndgione of suggmatiore songairverd in mig tuilecie are made withecul\ngatent cwned by AQat or cahers is not id be infempd frarn anty strmapnt conrsined harpln.\n- A Clvlslon of Arther Dantels Midland Company -\nTOTAL P.02"
