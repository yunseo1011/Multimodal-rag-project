Lyons-Hart\nSubject: .EGA of ART Feed Filler Treated with Ammonium Bicarbonate\nC89-00571\nTwo samples of ART feed filler before extraction were submitted for\nevolved gas analysis(EGA). Water content of a control sample was adjusted\nto a target ov of ~26% by overspray. Another sample was sprayed with a\nsolution of water and ammonium bicarbonate to a content of ~3% AB by weight\nand a target ov of -26%. Three 10 gram samples of each were analyzed by the\nstandard oven volatiles method(ov). The average ov was determined to be\n22.2% for the ART feed control and 23.3% for the AB treated sample.\nEach sample was analyzed using a 0.5 gram aliquot by the standard EGA\ntechnique using nitrogen gas as the carrier. Water is expected to be the\nmajor component lost in the Ov oven. Figure 1 shows the water profiles of\nboth samples. The evolved water profile for the AB treated feed filler is\nslightly broader and more intense in the temperature range of ~25°c to\n120°C, also the AB treated feed filler shows a larger loss of water from\n-12o°c to 160°c. These data are consistent with the Ov results.\nAmmonium bicarbonate has been reported to begin decomposition at 6oc,\nand to be decomposed by hot water. The break down products are as follows:\nammonia=21.5%, carbon dioxide=55.7%, water=22.8%.1 The 100°c temperature of\nan ov oven is certainly high enough to decompose the ammonium bicarbonate.\nAB has a endothermic heat of solution. Possibly, a heat loss could be\ndetected before a major transition or reaction takes place. Rate profiles\nfor the EGA technique are compiled from temperature readings taken from the\nthermocouple inside the sample. Once the EGA oven is started it attempts to\nheat the sample at a rate of 5°c per minute. When reactions are of such a\nmagnitude to shift heat load, they can be recorded as rate fluctuations.\nIn Figure 2, the rate profiles for both samples are shown. The AB treated\nfeed filler exhibits two endotherms, (#1) occurring - 104°c and (#2) -\n119°c. Figure 3 is the scale expanded comparison of the carbon dioxide,\nammonia, and water profiles for the AB treated feed filler. The #1\nendotherm appears to coincide with changes in the evolution of ammonia and\ncarbon dioxide. When the temperature of the sample has reached 104°c, the\n2022206579\ncarbon dioxide concentration is on the rise while the ammonia is declining.\nAs these gases appear to track downward just before the observed endotherm,\nsome type of reaction seems to be initiated. The melting point of ammonium\nbicarbonate is 107.5°c.² This endotherm may indicate this transition, but\nit is difficult to ascribe one reaction to an event because of the\ncomplexity of chemistry during thermal degradation. The profiles shown in\nFigure 3 have the following maximum evolution temperatures: water= - 84°C,"
