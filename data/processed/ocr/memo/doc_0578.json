Ford\nSUBJECT: Site visit with Dr. Ferid Murad and staff at the Palo Alto Veteran's\nAdministration Hospital associated with Stanford University, October\n20, 1981\nGrant No. 1186A\n\"Mechanism of Nitric Oxide Activation of Guanylate Cyclase\"\nMOVE FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE TO STANFORD:\nThe transition from Virginia to California appears to have been achieved\nwith a minimal disruption of Dr. Murad's investigations. Half of his staff moved\nwith him to the VA Hospital to establish the new laboratories while the other half\nmaintained the ongoing work at the University of Virginia and then moved out to\nCalifornia early in the Fall,bringing most of their equipment. The present quar-\nters for Dr. Murad's laboratory are much larger than were available to him before.\nIn addition, he has eighteen fully funded lines at the VA Hospital plus six funded\non grants. He appears quite excited about the research potential at his new loca-\ntion and is particularly gratified with the lines of comunication they have already\nbeen able to establish with individuals at Stanford. Further, the general attitude\nof the staff toward research appears much better. Support for equipment by the VA\nis also much better than at Virginia. Thus, at this time, Dr. Murad feels that his\nchange in location has enhanced the program which he directs and that the administra-\ntive demands he now has are no greater than they were before.\nPERSONNEL:\nMost of Dr. Murad's key people came with him to California. He has also\nobtained a number of new Post Doctoral Fellows, most of whom havemanaged to obtain\ntheir own financial support from private or governmental sources.\nCURRENT GROUP:\nJohn Lewicki, Ph.D.\nStarted 1979, plans to stay two more years.\nMarty Draznin, M.D.\nStarted 1979, also plans to stay on a few years.\nRobert Rapaport, Ph.D.\nStarted 1980, has a year to go.\nStarted 1979, also plans to stay on a few more\nScott Waldman, Ph.D.\nyears.\nNEW:\nWilliam Pierce, Ph.D.\nStarted 1981\nMartin Sinacore, Ph.D.\nStarted 1981\nGermain Guryson, Ph.D.\nStarted 198l, trained in neuropharmacology with\nCosta.\nMary Oldwurtel, Ph.D.\nComing in February, 1982\nMargie Oriano, Ph.D.\nCollaborating from Vermont.
