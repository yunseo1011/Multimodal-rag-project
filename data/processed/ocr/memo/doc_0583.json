Data used in this study were the latest Oriental\ninventory dated 9/3o/87 provided by Leaf Accounting, estimated average\nmonthly usings based upon the latest sales forecasts, and l986 and\n1987 crop orders as well as a projected l988 crop order. Our latest\norders and estimated order are also based upon a 30 month duration\npolicy, which represents a 6 month reduction in target inventories at\nOctober 1st.\nPast experience shows that any particular crop years' order will be\navailable for use in Macon two years later, and is usually moved into\nMacon during the first six months of the year. Therefore, for this study\nit was assumed that each years' order would be received in Macon in equal\nshipments two years later during the period January through June. For\nexample, l/6 of each grade ordered from the l986 crop would be received\neach month January through June of 1988.\nThe resulting study, then, indicates the following significant points:\nDuring the period 10/l/87 through 10/1/88 our inventories\ndecline to realize our desired duration reduction. At lo/l/88,\nand every October lst thereafter through l/l/9l, the overall\niaventory represents 5-6 months of usings, reflecting the\ndesired six month reduction.\nFor tbe period 7/1/88 through 1/l/9l, inventories will be at\ntheir lowest at January lst, and at their highest July lst, of\nany year.\n583100497"
