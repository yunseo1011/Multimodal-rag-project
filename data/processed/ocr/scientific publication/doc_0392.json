Am J Epidemiol 1985;121:645-50.\nThe mortality attributable to ischemic heart disease as a result of cigarette\nsmoking is greater than that due to lung cancer. Between 1972 and '1974, in a\nprospective study of a community of older adults in southem Californis, the\nauthors tested the hypothesis that nonsmoking women exposed to their hus-\nband's cigarette smoke would have an elevated risk of fatal ischemic heart\ndisease. Married women aged 50-79 years who had never smoked cigarettes (n\n= 695) were classified according to the husband's self-reported smoking status\nat entry into the study: never, former, or current smoker. After 10 years, non-\nsmoking wives of current or former cigarette smokers had a higher total (p ≤\n0.05) and age-adjusted (p ≤ 0.10) death rate from ischemic heart disease than\nwomen whose husbands never smoked. After adjustment for differences in risk\nfactors for heart disease, the relative risk for death from ischemic heart disease\nIn nonsmoking women married to current or former cigarette smokers was 14.9\n(p ≤ O.1o).
