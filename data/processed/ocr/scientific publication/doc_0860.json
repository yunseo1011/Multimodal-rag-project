WEAVER and WILLIAM A. PETRI, JR*\nFrom the Departments of Medicine, Microbiology and Pathology. Unirersity of Virginia School of Medicine,\nCharlotteswille VA 22908, USA\nReceived 19 April 1994, revised 17 June 1994\nAdherence of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites to host cells is mediated by a galactose (Gal) and\nN-acetylgalactosamine (Ga!NAc)-specific surlace lectin. The lectin is a heterodimeric protein composed of heavy\n(170 kDa) and light (35- 3t kDa) subunits lnked by disulfide bonds. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies\n(mAb) raised against a light subunit-glutath-one-S-transferase fusion protcin were used to probe its structure\nand function. Four light subunit-specific mAb were produced which recognized distinct epitopes on five different\nlight subunit isoforms. Immunoblots with these mAb demonstrated co-migration of light and heavy subunits\nwhen nonreduced trophozoite proteins were analysed by SDS.PAGE, indicating that thc subunits do not exist\nfree of the heterodimer in significant quantitics. While anti-heavy subunit antibodies had previously been shown\nto alter adherence, anti-light subunit antibodies did not, suggesting that the heavy subunit contains the\ncarbohydrate recognition domain.\nKeywords: lectin; Entamoeba histolytica; Entumoeba dispar; adherence; galactose; amebiasis.\nIntroduction\nsurvival of the extracellular trophozoite.
