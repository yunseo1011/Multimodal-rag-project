The sources were\n\"Sprague-Dawley\" from 4 commercial suppliers, Osborne-Mendel, and Oregon. Highly significant differ-\nences in the incidences of endocrine and mammary tumors were found. There were significant variations in\nthe incidences of adrenal medullary tumors among rats from the same source raised at 2 laboratories. Of\nthe rats with endocrine tumors, 9-15% had tumors in 2 or more endocrine glands. All but 1 of the testicular\ntumors occurred in Oregon rats. Thyroid and pituitary tumors were more common in females, adrenal medul-\nlary and Islet cell tumors of the pancreas were more frequent in males. Brain tumons occurred more often\nand at a younger age and were more apt to cause symptoms in males than in females. The incidence of\ntumors in \"Sprague-Dawley\" rats from different commerclal sources varied as much from each other as\nfrom the other \"strains.\" Factors that can affect the incidence of tumors and the difficulties in comparing\nthe rates of incidence reported in the literature were discussed. We stressed the need for extreme caution\nin evaluation of carcinogenicity studies conducted at different laboratories and/or on rats from different\nsources.-J Natl Cancer Inst 50: 1243-1257, 1973.\nIN LIGHT of today's concern with the carcino-\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\ngenic effect of environmental contaminants and\nfood additives, an understanding of the variation\nThe rats were from a series of long-term feeding studies\nin the incidence of tumors in sources of rats raised\non the toxicity of irradiated foods.
