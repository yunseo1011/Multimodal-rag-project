V.\nHONN\nDepartments of Radiation Oncology and Chemistry, Wayne State University, and Gershenson Radiation\nOncology Center, Harper Hospital, Detroit, MI, 48202, USA\nINTRODUCTION\nProtein kinase C (PKC), the Ca2+ and phospholipid dependent kinase, belongs to the family of\nprotein serine/threorine kinases. It is an important enzyme in mediating cell growth, cell differentiation\nand tumor promotion (1, 2). Physiologically, PKC is activated by diacyiglycerol (DAG) generated during\nphosphatidylinositol (Pl) turnover. Metabolism of Pl is usually initiated by the action of phospholipase C in\nresponse to extracellular factors including hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. In addition to\nDAG, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is generated during PI turnover. While DAG activates PKC, IP3\nmoblizes intracellular Ca2+(3). Tumor promoting phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate\n(PMA), directly activates PKC by a mechanism similar to that of DAG (3).\n12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE], a lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid,\nmimics the effect of PMA and increases surface expression of the αllbβ3 integrin and enhances tumor\ncell adhesion to endothelium and subendothelial matrix (4). This implies a protein kinase C mediated\nmechanism of action for 12(S)-HETE. In fact, a number of fatty acids including arachidonic acid and some\nof its metabolites [including 12(S)-HETE] are able to directly activate protein kinase C in vitro (5-9).\nRecently we reported that 12(S)-HETE increased adhesion to endothelium of rat Walker 256\ncarcinosarcoma (W256) cells by activation of PKC (10).\nTumor cell metastasis is a multi-step process involving interactions among tumor cells and host\ncells (11, 12). We reported that subpopulations of cells, differing in their lung colonization potentials,\ncould be isolated from B16a amelanotic melanoma (B16a) tumors by centrifugal elutriation (13). A\npositive correlation has been observed among lung colonization potential (13), ability to induce platelet\naggregation (13), plasma membrane expression of αllbβ3 integrin (14) and levels of cysteine proteinases\ncathepsin B and L (15, 16) in these B16a subpopulations. In this study, we compared the levels of PKC\nand 12(S)-HETE in these subpopulations. We also studied the effect of 12(S)-HETE on their adhesion\nto the matrix protein fibronectin.
