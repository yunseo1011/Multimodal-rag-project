The addition of sugars to tobacco relatively high in amino\ncCO.\nacids undoubtedly influences the smoke composition with respect to pyrazines.\nIn the instance of major carbohydrate additions, such as the use of cellulose derivatives as bonding\nagents in some of the reported tobacco sheet-making processes or as base materials in some of\nthe recently publicized synthetic smoking materials, the effect on gross smoke composition is more\npronounced. In addition to an increase in some of the volatile aldehydes, a decrease in the tobacco\nspecific components such as nicotine and isoprene occurs (4).\nHumectants represent another class of additive, typified by glycerine and propylene glycol.\nLaurene et al (26) have studied the transfer of both of these glycols to mainstream smoke. For a\n70 mm nonfilter cigarette, the amount of propylene glycol transferred is 19.2%, and glycerine 8.9 %.\nAthough I am unaware of extensive decomposition studies on these compounds, it may be\nreasonably inferred that some decomposition occurs since the transfer rates are low when\ncompared to menthol or dotriacontane (19, which contribute minor concentrations of\ndecomposition products to mainstream smoke. It would generally be expected that decomposition\nof the glycols would be similar to some of the simple carbohydrate decomposition products.\ncontributing little, if any. detectable gross alteration in smoke composition. Using a 1% addition of\npropylene glycol and 2% of glycerine, smoke volumes for 7Omm cigarettes as previously estimated\nand the above transfer rates, smoke would contain approximately 9 mg/I of propylene glycol and\n8.6 mg/l of glycerine.\nAnother additive which may have some use on tobacco is that of the inorganic type. For this\npresentation, I will confine this to two materials: nitrate, and phosphate. Both of the materials may\nbe considered as natural leaf components. but from a review of the literature have received attention\nas additives.\nNitrates have been the subject of considerable experimentat research (5O), and one of the major\neffects on smoke composition is through the production of nitrogen oxides.
