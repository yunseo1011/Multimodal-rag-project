HDL. apoprotem A.-1\nINTRODUCTION\nLecithin- cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (EC 2.3.1.43) is a plasma enzyme\nwhich catalyzes esterification of cholesterol on high-density lipoproteins (HDL)\nby transferring a fatty acid from the C-2 position of phosphatidyl choline to free\ncholesterol (Glomset. 1968). HDL apoprotein A-I is an important cofactor in this\nreaction (Ficlding and Fielding. 1971: Soutar e1 al. 1975). Although the metabolic\nsignificance of the LCAT reaction has not been completely elucidated. Glomset\n(1979) has postulated that LCAT may be involved in the removal of excess phos-\npholipid and free cholesterol from lipoprotein remnants and may participate in the\nmobilization of cholesterol from peripheral cell membranes and its subsequent\ntransport to the liver.\nHDL. serves as the lipoprotein substrate for LCAT and may also have\nantiatherogenic properties related to its ability to remove cholestero! from extru-\nhepatic tissue (Glomset and Norum. 1973: Glomser. 1979). Numerous epidemio-\nlogical studies have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between HDL\ncholesterol concentration and the incidence of coronary heart disease (Gordon el\nal.. 1977: Castelli er al., 1977). A similar correlation also exists between coronary\nheart diseasc and HDL's major protein component. apoprotein A-I (Berg et al..\n1976). Much recent attention has focused on HDL. levels and established heart\ndisease risk factors such as cigarette smoking (Enger er al. 1977: Hulley et al..\n179 Berg er al.. 1979: Garrison cr ul.. 1978). Results from these studies show that\nsmoking reduces HDL. cholesterol (Enger et al.. 1977: Hulley et al. 1979: Garri-\nson er ul.. 1978) and apoprotcin A.I and A-ll levels (Berg er al.. 1979).\n0014-4800 81 040025-11502.00 0\nCapynghe d) rogi by Academac Phess.
