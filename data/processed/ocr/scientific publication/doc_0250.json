Each subject wore a personal air sampler for 24 h, answered a questionnaire\nabout air quality and ET'S exposure, and provided saliva samples for cotinine analysis before and\nfer the monitoring period. The stedy was conducted in the Leeds and Harrogate areas of northern\nEngland. Median exposure to ETS particles was below the detection limit of 4 μg m'. Median\nexposure to nicotine was 0.5 ug m\" and median saliva cotinine levels were O.7 ng mL and\n0.6 ng mL. for the pre- and post-cotinine samples. Median exposure to particles from all souroes\nwas 142 ug m'. Approximxtely 80% of subjecis assessed their ETS exposure as none or low.

However, for exposure assessed as moderate or high there was a wids range\nin the corresponding direct measurements.

Exposure to ETS particles did not correlate (R²-O.04) with\nexposure to particles from all sources.
