Massover\nDepartment of Anatomy, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)- New Jersey Medical School,\n100 Bergen Street, Newark, NJ 07103 (U.S.A.)\n(Received November 12th, 1984)\nKey words: Ferritin; Isoferritin; Iron metabolism; Heterogeneity: (Mouse liver)\nAs much as 4% of the total protein in pure liver ferritin from mice with short-term parenteral iron overload\nproduces a minor band migrating anodally to the major (alpha) band of holoferritin with non-denaturing\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The components in this minor band and the alpha band have been isolated\nto purity by preparative electrophoretic fractionation. The protein in the minor band is ferritin, since it\ncontains ferric iron and fulfills defining criteria at the level of biochemistry, immunology and ultrastructure.\nNative polyacrylamide electrophoresis with pore-size-gradient gels shows that the ferritin molecules in the\nminor band have a slightly smaller diameter than the holoferritin in the alpha band. Isoelectric focusing\nreveals that the smaller ferritin has an identical number and range of charge isomers (p 4.95.3) as the\nlarger ferritin, but the relative amount of each size class within some isoferritin bands differs. The smaller\nferritin molecules are structurally intact and are made from polypeptide subunits with M, 18 o00; the larger\nferritin molecules have subunits with M, 220oo. The minor species of hepatic ferritin thus has a smaller\nmolecular size because it is made mainly from smaller subunits. No minor electrophoretic band can be\ndetected in liver ferritin obtained from mice with normal iron levels. These results demonstrate that siderosis\ninduces the formation of molecular size polymorphism (macroheterogeneity) in mouse liver ferritin. The new\nsmaller hepatic ferritin could serve to redistribute excess iron into the main storage organs during the early\nresponse to iron overload, since it appears to be identical to one of the two types of serum ferritin molecules\npresent in these siderotic mice.\nIntroduction\nsynthesize and assemble new apoferritin [5,6].
