Jakob\nTo: Charlie Mays\nObject:\nThe object of this work was to do a preliminary evaluation of the effects of\nmicrowave delamination of compacted tobacco on some tobacco characteristics.\nSummary:\nCompacted grades of flue-cured, burley, and turkish tobacco were delaminated\nwith microwave energy. The temperature of the tobacco was raised to 175 F. or\ngreater. Tobacco samples were analyzed for total sugars, % nicotine, and es-\nsential oils. Cigarettes were made for each grade and smoked on an expert\npanel. Controls were non-microwaved tobacco of the same grade.\n'Results indicate that microwave delamination does not significantly alter the\nchemical or smoking characteristics of the tobacco tested.\nResults & Conclusions:\nOverall, compacted tobacco heated to temperatures of 140 F. or above with\nmicrowave energy was totally delaminated by the treatment. The tobacco heated\nwith microwaves was hot and soft at these temperatures.\nTable l lists the results of samples analyzed for total sugars and % nicotine.\nThe results indicate that the microwave treatment had no effect on the total\nsugars or % nicotine in any of the grades tested. Differences in the number\ncan be explained by the general variation of these characteristics in tobacco\nand the test procedures. The treatment of a larger amount of tobacco with\nincreased sampling would be needed to accurately define any differences that\nmight be present.\nThe samples taken for essential oil analysis were run in duplicate. Results\nof this evaluation are listed in Table 2. These results show that there is no\ndifference in the essential oil. content of the tobacco before and after the\nmicrowave treatment.\n50810 0310"
